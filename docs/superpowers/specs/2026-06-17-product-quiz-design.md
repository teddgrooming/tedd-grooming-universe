## Architecture

Single HTML file. Structure:

1. **Intro screen** — Tedd Grooming wordmark + "Find your perfect product" headline + Start button
2. **Question screens (1–5)** — progress bar, question text, 3–4 option buttons, Next button
3. **Result screen** — product card as described above

All state (current question, answers, scores) lives in JS variables. No localStorage, no server calls. Score weights defined as a lookup table — each answer increments scores for relevant products by a defined weight value.

---

## Scoring Weight Logic (to be tuned during implementation)

Each answer maps to a score delta per product. Example signals:

- Thick + strong hold + matte → Styling Clay, Mattifying Dust
- Thick + strong hold + wet look → Hairspray, Fixing Pomade parfum
- Any + medium hold + wet look + fiber → Fixing Pomade mixfruit / parfum
- Fine + light hold + natural → Grooming Fixer, Moisturizing Fixer
- Classic + control hold + shine → Classic Pomade
- Firm + pump + volume → Hair Mousse

Every product must be reachable. No product should be a dead end.
